\begin{notation}
    In the proof I will use the following notation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \(\Segment{AB}\) represents a line segment bounded by the points \(A\) and \(B\);
        \item \(\Triangle{ABC}\) represents a triangle with vertices \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\);
        \item \(\TriangleArea{ABC}\) represents the area of a triangle with vertices \(A\), \(B\) and \(C\).
    \end{itemize}
\end{notation}
