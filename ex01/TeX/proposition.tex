\begin{proposition}
    Given an angle with vertex \(A\) and a point \(O\) in its interior. Pass a line through the point \(O\) that cuts off from the angle a triangle of minimal area. If \(B\) and \(C\) are the intersection points of the line with the two sides of the angle then \(\Segment{BO} = \Segment{CO}\).
